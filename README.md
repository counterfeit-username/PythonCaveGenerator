# PythonCaveGenerator
A python script which generates a 2d map containing a cave.

To use, run this script from a terminal.
Command syntax is: python generator.py *map_height* *map_width* *save_file_path*

It will both print the result to the terminal, and save the map in a .json file at *save_file_path*.
The *save_file_path* argument is optional and will simply print to the terminal if omitted.
